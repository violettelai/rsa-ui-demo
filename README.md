# RSA Encryption Scheme (Java, 1024-bit) – UI Demonstration
This project implements the **RSA encryption scheme** in Java, using **1024-bit key size**, and demonstrates secure communication between a **Sender** and a **Receiver** through a **graphical user interface (GUI)**.

This project is for educational purposes only.

## Project Objective
- Implement the **RSA public-key cryptosystem** in Java
- Generate **1024-bit** RSA keys
- Simulate message encryption and decryption between sender and receiver
- Provide a **GUI interface** for users to interact with and observe each step in the RSA process
- Display key processes like key generation, ciphertext creation, and plaintext recovery

## Features

- **Key Pair Generation**  
  Generates 1024-bit RSA public and private keys for sender and receiver.

- **Encryption (Sender)**  
  Converts plaintext into ciphertext using the receiver’s public key.

- **Decryption (Receiver)**  
  Decrypts received ciphertext using their private key to retrieve original message.

- **User Interface (GUI)**  
  Interactive interface to simulate and visualize sender-receiver communication:
  - Input plaintext
  - View generated keys
  - See encrypted and decrypted message
